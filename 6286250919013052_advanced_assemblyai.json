  "feedback": "Strengths: The student was able to communicate the main ideas of the movie plot, demonstrating an understanding of the task and maintaining topic relevance throughout the conversation. The use of phrases like 'fear of height' and 'main character' shows an effort to use appropriate vocabulary for the context. Weaknesses: The student's speech was marked by frequent hesitations and fillers ('um', 'uh'), which impacted the overall fluency. Grammar control needs improvement, as there were instances of incorrect verb tense usage and sentence structure, which sometimes made the narration hard to follow. Additionally, the use of cohesive devices was limited, affecting the logical flow and coherence of the speech.",

    "full_transcript": "Hi. Hi there. Happy to talk to you again. How are you doing? Um, I'm, um. Good. Good. What did you do last weekend? Um, I, um. Uh, I watched the movie. Hm. It was four. I don't know the English name, but four. 600 meter. Oh, is it about mountain climbing? Oh, yes, but they climb the tower. Very high tower. And yes, it in. It made me feel, um, scary. M. I have fear of height. Yeah, me too. Yes. Right. Is it a happy story or a sad story? Because it sounds like, you know, adventurous and scary. Did somebody die? Yeah. And was it the main star? Oh, no, her friend. And that is the, uh, you know, the twist. Aha. Yes. Uh, yes. Um, main. Main character. Think, um, her friend alive, but it was her imagination. Ah, yeah. Her friend was. Died. Oh no. But why did they climb that? Is it for survival or is it for fun? Uh, for fun. They love climbing. They love mountain climbing. And back in the day they climbed the rock mountain and you know, um, main character's boyfriend, um, died. Huh. Because he fell. Yeah. Right. That is a painful way to go. Yes. So, um. Yeah, so main character, um, stopped climbing. But few years later, um, they. They did. They did. And somebody died again. Yes. Oh, you know, when I watched a documentary about climbing Mount Everest, it's going to cost around $80,000 every. For, you know, that's what a person needs to spend to go to Everest. $80,000 is a lot of money. And. And there's no assurance that they will be alive at the end of the climb to Everest. Yes. I respect those people who find fulfillment in doing something dangerous like this. But if I have a friend or family member who likes to do this. I will stop them from doing it. And I will tell them to find their fulfillment on safer things. Not in something as dangerous. Dangerous as that. Yes, me too. Right. So you're afraid of heights. Does it mean that you don't like the roller coaster? Um, I really like roller coaster. Yes. That's really, um, thrilling and very fast and I, I think it's fine. But you know, um, in Korea, I don't know, um, the name, but you know, Gyro Drop, I think. Okay. Gyro Drop. It's like Tower Drop. Oh yeah. Tower Drop. Yes. I, um. I'm not able to. I mean, how can I say I. Don'T have the courage to try it. I don't have the courage to try it. Same here. I'm looking at pictures and videos and I don't even want to imagine what it's like to be there. Yes. Right. Yeah. Uh, okay. All right, so, um, let's study our book. Um, lesson 11. Um, part E. Okay. Party. Hold on. My book is loading. Party. Oh. Why is it not loaded? Okay, let's do this. What number? Oh, number one. Okay, so I've heard a lot of great things working in this company. I know it's too personal to ask, but how is. How is your experience working? I work here for two years, and, um, I have my heart in the right place. Um, what I like the most is a flexi time schedule. So, um, as long as you work for eight hours, um, you can start working whenever you want. Wow. Okay. Very good. I like how you were able to use the expressions. Okay, next one. I think being employed here for a long period of time is worth it. Uh, yes, I agree. Um, first, um, salary is high, and, um, um, we can do various projects here. Okay, next one. However, I'm planning to request for a flexi time. Do you think it will be approved? Um, well, I'm not sure, but I think it is hard because, um, the policy. The company's policy is fixed. And, um, I think, um, it is hard to accommodate this one. One person's recap. Okay. All right, good. And then next. I really appreciate your very honest responses. Um, you're welcome. If you have other questions, feel free to ask. Okay. Very good. Yeah, I think you did a very good job. Do you have any questions for this chat? Um, no. That's okay. Okay, so now let us do the next part. Stress in the workplace. Please read part A. Um, occupational stress is a very common situation in the workplace, which stems from a lot of factors like job pressure, interpersonal relationship, position, stagnation, unsatisfactory benefits, and so on. These are devastating circumstances which put workers at risk for physical illness. So proper management should be exercised. Okay, good. Let us do the dialogue. You're going to be Miriam. I will be Alice. Go ahead and start. Hi there. It's just 10am but you already seem to be worn out. Honestly, I've bent out of shape because of Mr. Clint. Why? What happened? I always bear the brunt. Even the slightest mistake on my report. Oh, I thought you were already over it. I mean, boss was born to be a, um, perfectionist. And the thing is, it's just purely about work. So cheer up and just let it pass. I think you just need some air. I guess it's much ado about nothing. Okay, so what were they talking about? Um, they are talking about, um. Alice got mad because of her boss. Her m. Boss. Um, M. Pointed out the slightest mistake of, um. Her red part. Yeah, that's right. Okay, so that is a very stressful situation. Yes. Go to part C, number one. Worn out. Go ahead and read the meaning. Um. Worn out. Feeling exhausted, Too tired. Okay, sentence. Um. Um. She is worn out after a. Um. Painfully long. Okay. She is worn out after a painfully long project. Okay, good. It is painfully long. I would be worn out too. Uh, next one. Bent out of shape. A person become annoyed or upset about something that is usually not that important or cannot be avoided. Okay, please say annoyed. Annoyed. Not W. You need Y. It's not a no end. Yeah, yeah. Y sound annoyed. Okay. All right. Make a sentence. Um, well, um. Um. She is bent out of shape because her colleague complain about everything. Okay, right. Sometimes it's very. It's not comfortable to be with negative co workers. Yes. Right. Um, right. Okay, next one. Bear the brunt. One who suffers the most when something bad or unpleasant happens. Okay, sentence. Um, he always wear the front. Um, you can always put an S. Always bears the brunt. He always bears the brunt. Um, his frequent mistake. He always bears the brunt about his frequent mistakes. He always bears the brunt about his frequent mistakes. Okay, good. Next, over about something. The indication that a negative event is no longer bothersome to someone. Okay. M. He can. Over. Mhm. Um, he, uh. He can over. About fear. Not. Not really. But I want to hear the meaning first. Ah. Uh, fear of water. Ah, that's different. That is get over. He can get over his fear of water. It's not over about. It's a different expression. Okay. For example, my ex boyfriend starts dating another girl and I would say I don't care, I'm over him. Uh, it means it doesn't bother me anymore. That situation of, you know, something negative is not. It's. I'm okay with it. I don't care anymore. That's over about something. Um, okay, so on our dialogue when Alice. When Alice was complaining about her boss, Miriam said. Oh, really? You're still bothered by that? I thought you're over it. M. Yeah, a bit different from. Yeah, from get over. Uh. Okay, next one. Born to. As if someone was born having a specific characteristic. Example. To be born to be perfect in average. Okay, sentence. Um. Um. She is born to be a superstar. She's born to be a superstar. Good. All right, sentence. That's it. Right, that's your sentence. Yeah. Okay, next one. Purely, um, Purely, um. Um. I'm not sure it is right, but um, don't take it personally. Um, it's just purely a bad word. Yeah, yeah. Very good and very common way to use it. Okay, next. Let something pass. To let something go unnoticed or unchallenged. Um. Um, uh, in order to keep my mental health, I just let, um, something traumatic. Mhm. Pass. Yeah, that's right. Don't let it bother you. Okay, and then what should do about nothing? Um. Much to do about nothing. If people make much ado about nothing, they make a lot of fuss. They make a lot of fuss. Fuss. They make a lot of fuss about something which is not important. Making a big deal. Even if it's not a big deal. Um, yeah. Ah, okay, I got it. My boss, uh, make matado bun not thing. If I do some small mistake. Mistake. Okay, um, one more time. Um. My boss makes much ado uh, about nothing. Whenever I. I, um, make. I do some mistakes. Small mistakes. Okay. My boss makes a big deal out of my small mistakes. Even if it's much ado about nothing. Oh, One more time. Okay. My boss makes a big deal out of small mistakes. Even if it's much ado about nothing. Uh, my boss makes you makes a big deal out of my small mistake. Yes. Even if it's Even it's much ado about nothing. Even if it is much ado about nothing. Uh, even if it is much ado about nothing. Yeah, that's right. Okay. Right. Because, you know, much ado about nothing is not really used as a verb. It's a situation when people make a big deal out of something that is not important. So we cannot use it as a verb. That's why we had to rephrase your sentence. Okay, Okay, I got it. Thank you. Awesome. Um, see you again on Wednesday. Take care. Bye. Thank you. Bye.",
