  "feedback": "Strengths: The student demonstrates a good ability to maintain a logical flow throughout the conversation, which is evident in the way they connect ideas and transition between topics. Their use of phrases like 'very tough time' and 'maintain their countries' shows an attempt to use more complex vocabulary. Weaknesses: Grammar control is somewhat inconsistent, with noticeable errors that impact the overall clarity of the message. Additionally, while the student attempts to use advanced vocabulary, there's room for improvement in consistently incorporating higher-level vocabulary to enhance the richness of the conversation.",

    "full_transcript": "Some pops? Yes. If you have any chance to meet some friends. Old friends? I guess so, maybe. But I think honestly now most of them live outside Seoul. Uh, they took like a job or they moved out to like Gyeonggi do somewhere to start a kyosukso or something like that. It's too expensive living in Seoul. Unless you've got a regular job. Oh, yeah. Or family that you can, uh, help you with an apartment and things like that. Yeah. I think for English teachers, it's like Seoul is the young person's place. Uh, you know, because the company or the hagwon or the school gives you a one room, you know, they'll pay your rent for just a small one room. Um, but I'm sure they're getting smaller and more smaller. Almost like goshiwon kind of size or something even there. Sure. Yeah. I think I stayed one or two nights before I could move into my apartment or something. They gave me a heat tank. Then there must be a very tough time staying in Dokoshiwan. Exactly. So I think if you get a family, you know, a Korean wife like most people my age who are, uh, still teaching, it's because their wife is Korean. Uh, and so they move out of. Uh, the outside of Seoul. Um. The older guys all live outside of Seoul. And then the young people who just come here for one or two years, they all live in Seoul, have fun, and then go home and go home. And maintain their countries. Anybody who's here for as long as I've been here probably doesn't live in Seoul. No. Uh, well, what made you come to Korea when you made your mind? The very first time? Yeah, very first time. I. Of course, I. Well, no, I guess not, of course, because many people don't plan to do this, but I did it because I wanted to be a teacher, not because I wanted to Seoul. But, um, about 10 years ago, the career was not so much. No, not at all. Not at all. Not at all. So, um, yeah, when I first came here, it was. I wanted to become a teacher in the uk and um, I did two years working in a high school. Not as a teacher, as like a kind of assistant. Okay. I thought, I'm too boring, I'm too young for this. I'm not really good at, uh, disciplining the students or anything. So I'll go get some experience. And somebody mentioned you should go abroad, uh, to teach English to get some teaching experience and might have a adventure. So actually I applied to go to Japan. Exactly. That's what I meant. Yeah. So many people, many the black youth, they want to go to Japan, not Korea. And it wasn't, again, it wasn't because of Japan. It wasn't, you know, any particular reason. It was just Japan had the best deal. Um, like the salary and the living conditions were better than China or, um, actually in Europe. Uh, it's more people my age who teach English in, in Spain or in Greece or somewhere like that. Like, they'll live there for a long time. Yeah. And learn Spanish and, um, live in Spain teaching English. Um, at that point it was much long, more long term. Korea and Japan were like, go for one year, go for two years, get some experience. Um, so when I first came, it was a mix between people who wanted to visit Asia and, um, people who wanted to be a teacher. And maybe at that time it was like 70% wanted to see Asia and 30% wanted to be a teacher. So actually Japan turned m. Me down. It was much more competitive because it was the government program. Um, um, it was the government program. So. And then I saw that Korea had just started their own government program program. Uh, yeah. Teaching in a middle school. Yeah. Yeah. So it was called, ah, it was the sole metropolitan office of education, uh, English program. So that's only for like a one or two years back that they have. A. I think you could teach for up to five years and then change the school. Um, change the school. Yeah. But I just did two years. Um, but yeah, rather than. I've never taught in a hagwon or anything like that. I was always public school and then university. Was there any. Anyone you know, um, in Korea when you come here? No. How did you get your. Meet your wife? Oh, we met in the uk So I did two years. I did two years, uh, in Seoul. Yeah. And then I went back to, uh, to the UK to study a Master's. Okay. And she was, uh, she did her final semester undergraduate because she wanted to be. She studied English education. Is it the same master degree and graduated graduate school? Yeah, graduated school. So Masters is one or two years. Yeah. And then PhD is, uh, four or five years. Yeah. So. So it's graduate school. Yeah, but it has same meaning, isn't it? Yeah, it's graduate school, but it's not PhD. No, it's, uh, it's Masters, which is MASC. Undergraduate is BA, BSc. I just know that the just normal university is called like, ah, oh, what's, uh, that. I just forgot the word. So it's called if it's your bachelor, graduate, and it's called Bachelor. So B.A. Yeah. B.A. bachelor. So Bachelor of Arts is BL. Bachelor of Science is BSC. Um, and so on. And then above, uh, that is Masters, which is graduate school. Ah, for two years. Yeah. And that's uh, MA or msc. So I did a mask. Uh, msc. Um, uh, although I don't know why, it's msc. Uh, East Asian Business and Economics. So I had a. I had this idea where I would, uh, work for some Korean company in the uk. It didn't work out. It didn't work out. But I got the, uh. I got the Masters. Uh, so I started teaching university here. Teaching, uh, Business, English M. At universities in Korea. So the Masters was helpful in that way. But no, we met in the uk. Yeah. And then came and moved back to Korea together. Yeah. Um, Although she had to stay in Jinju for one more year and I got a job in Bundang. Yeah. For one semester I was uh, going to Jinju every weekend on the bus. A long bus ride every weekend. Is it Quite far away? 4 and a half hours. So. But the bus time was like 6:30am on Saturday morning. So I would just wake up, go in there and fall asleep, uh. In a bus. In the bus. It was. It was one of those very nice buses. The cozy one. The true rows. Yeah. Separate, Right. So I always got the front row, single seat. Because not many people were going to Jinju very early in the morning. It was never busy. So I always just sat there. Wake up at about, uh, 9:00am at the rest stop. I always had a Oshima Hakba, like almost Korea, right? Oh yeah. And then, uh. And then she graduated and she came to Bunnan, Um, uh, to live with me, to do the, um. What do they call that? The test to be a high school teacher. Ah. Um, okay. So she was studying in Nuyangti. So that is the, the place for the. For the people who want to get to the qualified test. Exactly. So she lived with me in Bunan and got into Nonyangjin every day and studied all day. And then when she passed the test, uh, and became a teacher in Ulsan, I was like, oh, it got serious. Your wife got that. Have, um, graduated in the UK for the English education, I think. No, no. She only did one semester in the uk. Just one semester? Yeah. Like exchange school? Exactly. Like her final semester was, um, um, like. Yeah, exchange. Um, that semester made her life turn into her parents. One thing they said, uh, before she set off, she said. They said, uh, uh, don't come back with a, uh, foreign, uh, boyfriend. So I believe that Maybe your parental law. They speak English? No, not at all. Uh, well, uh, when I, as part of my masters, I studied Korean language. So. No, in the uk, yeah, the university had some Korean language courses. Uh, so yeah, my Korean at that time when I was studying hard was okay. So when I met them, I spoke some Korean and they were like, okay. And the most important thing, uh, I ate all of the food. My father in law has always been very happy because I've always eaten any food he's given me or recommended. Uh, even though the food is spicy. Yeah. Spicy. Smelly. Yeah, the smelly one. Yeah, yeah. Anything like that. Of course. So when he took me for, uh, some food and I ate it, well, he. So yeah, when she passed the test to be a, you know, public official teacher. Yeah. Ah, job for life. Yeah. That's when I thought, okay, I have to decide, do I move back to the UK or do I get married and stay in Korea? That was a big decision at that time. What about your, your parents? Your parents are waiting for you coming back to the uk? Well, kind of, but, uh, I mean, I'd lived in the, in the US for, uh, I'd studied in the US for one year and uh, I worked in the US for a couple of summers. So they always kind of thought I would try and live abroad. And my older sister, um, she's not there. I don't know why I looked there. Um, my older sister lives in Germany. She, uh, moved there straight after high school. She became a, uh, nanny. What kind of nanny? Like an au pair, like living with a family, taking care of their child. It was a professional opera singer. This opera singer was, uh, uh, touring Europe, so she. No, no, this professional opera singer, uh, they needed, uh, a nanny to live with them and uh, tour around Europe to look after their children. So straight after high school, uh, my sister got that job and toured around Germany, Austria, Switzerland, ah, looking after these children for this opera singer. And then she met a boy from Germany. Yeah. And she's lived in Munich, uh, since she was 18 years old. So already like, my parents were kind of accepting of their children. I have, they're four children. My older sister, me, my younger sister and younger brother. This nice ratio of gender. Right. And it's girl, boy, girl, boy. So the two older ones, we live abroad, and then the two younger ones are, uh, kind of living close to home and they, they look after my parents anyway. They have that tool still there. Uh, if I was the only child, then it would be more pressure to move back to the uk. I have a few friends who lived in Korea a long time, but recently, after about 15 years, they've moved back. Home because their parents get old. Parents are in 70s. Ah. And they. They feel guilty. Uh, it's the same way. Like the. Our Korean normally think that we should, uh, take care of their parents. Yeah, yeah, take care of them, but also spend time with them. You know, spend time with them before they. Whilst they're healthy and things. Before they're sick. So. Interesting. That's all about me. More of a listening class today. I spoke a lot there. Sorry about that. Told you my history.",
