  "feedback": "Strengths: The student was able to communicate the main ideas regarding their recent activities and experiences, showing an ability to stay on topic and share relevant information. The use of specific phrases like 'had to prepare' and 'signing ceremony' demonstrates an effort to use appropriate vocabulary for the context. Weaknesses: Grammar control and use of cohesive devices need improvement for clearer communication. The speech was somewhat disjointed, with pauses and filler words ('um', 'actually') disrupting the flow. Focusing on constructing more complex sentences and using connectors to link ideas could enhance clarity and coherence.",

    "full_transcript": "Extremely busy. That's why I couldn't attend this class. But actually since. Oh yeah, somebody came down and said you were in a meeting on um. Tuesday. Yeah, but since yesterday I have no work to do. Right. And the last time I spoke to you, you said you had some big things coming up. Yeah, in terms of a presentation, it didn't go well unfortunately, but yeah. In what way? The result or your performance? My performance, well, was not so bad, I think. And um, everyone in that room, they told me that your performance was good. They enjoyed it. Yes, but actually the result. Yes, a little bit. Not what you would have wanted a little bit. But actually I. I had that chance unexpectedly so. Well, I think it's a good experience. Okay. Chalk it up to experience. Okay. All right. Well, yeah, as long as you tried your best. And yeah, last week we had a very. There was a big event contracting with on some huge amount of contracts. Yeah, there was. There was a celebration on Friday. So I had to prepare the celebration. The event. Okay. Okay. What kind of thing is that? Is it. It's a signing ceremony actually. Well, it ended well. Yeah. That's why I do not have any room right now. So. Bunch of people taking photos together. Yes, of course. That kind of uh. Official signing. Actually the official signing ceremony was. Was on the newspapers. Okay. So uh. Yeah, big deal. Death. Do you enjoy that kind of work? No, definitely not. Well, maybe. Maybe I uh. Maybe I am a president or CEO of this company. Yes, I might enjoy that performance or that. That kind of event. But I'm the one who have. Who have had to. Who has to prepare that kind of event. And as you know, preparation is kind of uh, very suck. I. Yeah, I think it's kind of my least suited job. A job that least suits me. It seems like a lot of stress for. I don't know, I don't know it's suitable for me or not. But uh. It definitely the least preferable job. Right. Even like, you know, it's not the same thing at all. But I have no interest in organizing a birthday party. Mhm. Or something like that. You know, I don't understand the. Why they celebrate their. Well, no, no. What is the reward? You know, um. I'm much more of a kind of spontaneous and that's more fun. So you people go and they'll chat there. So if I organize an official signing ceremony, I would just have some wine, some cheese, a room and see what happens. That's my style. And everyone thinks that there is no preparation at all. Just no. You know, I Prepared some things, but, uh, you know, just, um. Yeah. Just more relaxed and. Yeah, well, some people, they prefer the formal. Right. Event organizing. Yeah. Yeah. But when I attend those things, uh, just find them very boring. Yes, that's right. So what? Yeah, actually, the actual sliding ceremony. Well, lasted only 15 minutes or 20 minutes, I think. But we have to. We. Our team had to prepare the whole event over two weeks. What a waste of time and waste of. What is it? Manpower. Right. But I. This might give you a hint as well, or a strong indication of my feeling. I didn't attend either of my graduation ceremonies. I had no interest in going to do a ceremony. Every school. Yeah, the high school. Oh, we don't have it for the. Schools really in the uk. Yeah. There's no graduation and so university, uh, undergraduate and master's degree. I just didn't go well when I was in elementary school, middle school and high school, it was kind of mandatory thing. Yeah. Yeah. So I guess we, me and my family should be there, right? Yeah. I don't think we had graduation ceremony, but there was some school assembly, but yeah, there's no parents coming to visit. Yeah. What is. What is the entering ceremony? What is it, uh, the, um. Or not the orientation. The, uh. Oh, what do we call that? Okay. Oh, the first day. Yeah, the. The inaugural event. Inaugural. Inaugural means like the first, but there's a specific word. You're right. Okay. Matriculation ceremony. Matriculation or entrance ceremony. Inauguration is like the beginning of somebody's. Somebody's inauguration. Yes, but. Okay. Matriculation. Yeah, Matriculation ceremony. Opening ceremony. Yeah. Actually, when I went to university, the matrimonial ceremony lasted about three hours or something. So me and my friends escaped. Escaped? Just in 10 minutes or something. Well done. We went to go to drink some illegal liquors. Oh, wow. At the time, I was minor. You are underage. Okay. I was gonna say jokes. Oh, okay. You were underage. Yes. And I graduated after the summer master. That's unusual in Korea. Actually, the formal graduation ceremony will be held in February or December because the semester of Korean University ended in December, but I graduated in July. So there will. There was a graduation ceremony, but a small one. And actually I didn't want to attend the ceremony, but for my family, I had to because my mom and dad was born. Very proud, uh, of my university name or something or so. Yeah. Yeah. I like you. I. I could have attended, but I. I just wasn't there. Actually, I was. I was in the United States when my, uh, undergraduate was on. And actually I Was in Korea already, but I didn't. I could have delayed and gone to. The ceremony, but I didn't take photos of the. The album of the year or something. I didn't take. I didn't take a photo. But actually, I don't know if you're interested in this. In the uk we don't graduate because there's something a little bit unique about the way that we take our exams. At the end, we don't take the exams in the school. So what we do during school time. Sorry, what we do is we leave school or we get. It's called stand down. So you stop having classes and then you take the test. Everybody in the country takes those tests on the same day at a different school. And then you get that you go back to your original school sometime late in summer to get your score. And that is when you're kind of finished with school. So there's no real like last day of school. There's no graduation. You stand now, you stop taking classes. You go back there to take the exams. And then two months later, at the end of the summer, you go back to get your results. And you don't have to wear your uniform or anything. There is no gown for this. Yeah. So you don't. Actually we don't. I think in America you graduate high school, we don't graduate high school. We leave high school. Huh? And then take our version of the sat. But each subject has its own exam paper. Everybody's taking different subjects. And so. Yeah, we never really have like one day that is like you have finished high school. Yeah. In Korea doesn't really happen. We ended up all the same day. Right. The weird thing in Korea is that you actually in high school. Ah, if you're taking the Suneung. Yes. You kind of finished high school way before you finished high school. Right. There's all that dead time. Yes, I know. After the sun. After the sune. Yes. Right. But there. There would be a final exam for the graduation. Uh, and there are mandatory dates or graduation. So students should attend the uh, rest of the classes because of their graduation. Right? Exactly. Yeah. Otherwise they won't graduate. They. Otherwise they dropped out. So we do the Sune style. But we do it right at the end of the year. And when it's finished, you're free. Mhm. So. So you don't really graduate. You just stop going to school. Anyway, I have something for you. Okay. This new session. Uh, I have started a Kakao open chat. All right. Uh, so if you go to Kakao and down here at the middle, you'll see open chat. All right, wait a minute. And you can search for. Okay. There we are. Yeah. Join the chat. Yeah, so all I'm doing is I'm going to share on Monday and Wednesday. All right. I'm going to share a couple of articles. Uh, this one's about bts, uh, finishing, uh, their military. The other one is UK versus US um, difference in language. Um, so once or twice a week, I'll share some articles if you can read them. And, you know, if you find it interesting, we can talk about that in class as a kind of an alternative to the textbook. There's too many differences. The British English and American English. So I sometimes confused because, um, my basic English is. My English is based on American English, so I have to pronounce adult. Ah, adult. Yeah. Right. I already confusing. Yeah, but sometimes I pronounce it adult, right? Yeah, yeah. I find it. I find new ones all the time. Things that I didn't know people are like, oh, you spelled it like that. Why did you spend. You know, I lived and worked in America for about two years, and actually, I still don't know all the differences. And actually, as Korean, the British English is much easier to pronounce. Right. Something like Rs down is not in Korean, so it's much easier. But. So I sometimes pronounce perfect, not perfect. And I have a. It's not a habit, but I pronounce half, not have, and past, not past is because of my father. He learned British English. Oh, interesting. M and not. But actually neither. Neither. Neither. Neither either. Which one is British? Which one is American? That's not a difference. It seems like it should be, but it's not. Um, I say both. I only say neither either. And I think the closest I found to a pattern that if it's early in the sentence, I say either. Uh, I'll have either, uh, rice or potatoes. Uh, but I don't know either when it's at the end of the sentence. For me, either is like the. It has more emphasis. So if it's at the end of the sentence, you want to emphasize it a little more. But no, you're right. There are, you know, skills, schedule. Schedule. That kind of thing. I've never pronounced the schedule. Um, but I'd say schedule. Um, I think the two languages, for some words, are getting closer. It's mixed up already. Yeah. So that is our. Do you know the classic phrase US and uk, Two countries divided by the same language? Why? So basically, we speak the same Language. But there are enough differences. Last of both that the differences are what divide us. You know. You know it's a. English and French are definitely. There's some relation but they're different languages. Yes, but the two are basically the same languages. So you, you two guys use the same language but the way you use. The way you use the. The language that makes you then makes all the differences. Yeah, exactly. All of the differences are really quite insignificant. Right? They're insignificant but because there's enough of them. It's what we talk about. Right? We talk about. Oh you say that, we say that. Oh you spell it this way, we spell it that way. Actually the British English and American English for me is quite easy to understand. But, but the Noodle Island Northern Islandish. Well accent is something different. Their English is not English. Well their pronunciation is uh, unique. Yes. Even the American and even the British they can understand what they say. Not necessarily. No. There's one sound that we are good at but yeah. And that's the Oyi song. Yeah. Yeah. I can't. Yeah I can. Instead of pound it's point and it's fun to say. Right. Five point please. This is really hard to understand. Yeah. If you go there, um, yeah. It's good fun though. I like it. I like comparing the two. And there's so much M on YouTube these days. Yes. You know, you say this um, etc. Um. So I don't know any, any that come to mind. What kind of for words. There are so many video clips for um, laughing at those British person living in. Living in US Such as bottle water. That kind of. And ah, there is one video clip that a. Wait, okay. A waiter who live in America and he's a also American too. And at the restaurant there, there is a customer who is British and uh, the, the waiter needs um, some translator to take orders. Well I have personal experience of this. I went to university for one year in America and in a very loud bar, uh, I just wanted some water. So the bartender was basically lip reading. So I said and he couldn't understand me. So I went, I got water instead of water. Water, water. It's water and ah. Okay. So uh, even lip reading you could tell the difference between water and water. One quick question. Often, often which way is American and which way is English, British or generally. Americans wouldn't put teas in um, in the UK depending on the accent. Uh, some people put in the T, some people don't. So American uh, is often where I'm from in the UK it's often. I pronounce it often. But southern uk, you would hear British English accent and say often. I don't know where my accent come from. Me neither. These days I. I'm a big mess now. I've lived in Korea too long. Okay. Thank you, Raymond. I will see you next time.",
