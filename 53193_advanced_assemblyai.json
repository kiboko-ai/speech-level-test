  "feedback": "Strengths: The student was able to maintain a conversation related to personal and financial situations, demonstrating an understanding of the task requirements. The use of specific terms like 'middle class' and 'financial planning' shows an attempt to use relevant vocabulary. Weaknesses: The speech was marked by frequent pauses, filler words, and some grammatical inaccuracies, which affected the overall fluency and coherence. The use of cohesive devices was limited, making the speech somewhat disjointed. Improving grammatical accuracy and practicing the use of connectors could enhance the logical flow of conversation.",

    "full_transcript": "What if the ordinary people who live in Seoul, who live in Bundan area. Do they own their house or rent? Yes, they own their house. Yes, yes. It's a very standard type uh, of uh, Korean family in Korea. So they already own their house. So just middle, Middle class. Uh, just guess My, my class. Middle class. Middle class will be fine. I'm not higher class. Uh. 4 million a month. 4 million won a month for the middle class? I don't know. It's a hard question. How much do you spend, uh, living expenses for your house? Ah, uh, you have kids? Yeah. So I mean I'm, I'm honest. I'm open and honest. So like um, I did everything here wrong and I m made like every mistake you could make. So, so I'm really like Las Vegas style. So I'm putting everything into my company that my company succeeds and we're doing okay right now. So I'm hoping that's going to work. So I spend everything each month. Okay. Okay. Because I want to keep my son and wife happy. And um, uh, I, Yeah. So that's my strategy right now. Because if, if, if, if I don't, if I don't let my wife and son like live and spend as much as they can then um, uh, my wife will start to worry about my startup business and if she worries about my startup business then I can't keep doing my start and my whole plan's ruined. So I make like right now I make like about 5 million a month. M. And we spend all of it. Everything. So you, you make 5 million won and you spend all of it. Right. The reason why I'm asking you how much will be enough for wife, uh, and husband to live for a month? Yeah. Is that actually just two weeks ago I had a consultant, um, which is uh, organized by my company. Okay. As you know I'm already 60 years old. Right. And I uh, I'm not sure if I will retire next year. I can extend my career in my company for more longer time. I don't know. But anyway, uh, company uh, provide me with uh, uh, some consulting service with a professional company and I have five sessions and one of five can uh, be the financial planning, planning for after my retirement. Sure. So I, I got uh, the consultant service, the financial planning and the consultant asked me how much do you think will be enough uh, for your monthly living cost? Sure. So I answered it. Five million. Okay. And then he gave uh, me a follow up uh question then. How much can you get from the. With a natural pension and other uh, individual uh, pensions. So when I uh, adopt all my pension then it could be uh, approximately four million. Okay. Monthly. Right. So he advised me of thinking uh, how I can with that add the remaining 1 million. Right. One for the financial planning. Right. So what's your solution? So he uh, told, he told that 10 million. No, not 10 million. 100 million. Uh, will worse of if I put out 100 million into the bank, then I can get uh, 30,000. Uh, no, not, not 30,000. 300,000 won per month. Right? 3%. Yes. Okay, so that seems pretty low. Yes. 3%. I was thinking it would be at least four and a half percent but. He, he just told, told me that uh, 1 million was um. 300,000 won per month. Mhm. So I should accumulate more, more money. Right. Okay. Deposit money. I mean the western. Is it temperature money or. Uh. Yeah, that deposit money. Savings account. You should build up your savings account. Yeah, yeah. You know this is like um. There's a really good word for this too which is financial M. Literacy. M. So literacy comes from the word like to be literate or to be illiterate. If someone is literate, they can read. Mhm. So you can read. You're literate. Someone who can't read, they're illiterate. So financial literacy means basically you understand. Find how it works. Yeah. So there's a big push for them to teach this like in high school because it's a real life skill and people complain like we're learning about history we never use. But we don't even teach financial literacy. So I had very little financial literacy. So I'm just starting to understand it a little bit now. But I think it's important. Right, Right. Very important. Especially when uh, I uh, approach the time of retirement. It m. Will be more and more. More important. Yeah. Right. Yes. So I, I realized that I was very uh, lazy of thinking. Thinking about the financial planning. Mhm. So he asked me what is your plan after your retirement? Right. You will be just uh, take a rest at home or you have more work in any, any. I mean that you have some job. Mhm. So I answered I. I will definitely get a job. Mhm. Even after retirement of ktmp. Right. So he agreed with my plan. Mhm. He, he. I mean he stony supported by plan. Right. Uh, we shouldn't stop our, our job, uh, our work at any, any position. Right. I uh, do my job. I mean that I will continue working in a company until 60, uh five at least. And he otherwise made me that don't uh, Open your own business. You will lose your money. Right. As soon as you open your business. Mhm. Uh, especially for the small restaurant or a small chicken. Korean chicken. Uh, restaurant kind of hop and chicken. Yeah. Kentucky Fried Chicken and also some Kap. Right, Copy. And something like that. Don't open it 100%. I agree, I agree with his advice. And he just uh, advised me to get a job in other area, other company. The restaurant business is very difficult. Like, you know, my wife owns, um, a Dunkin Donuts. Really? Yes. Right now? Yeah. But we don't make hardly any money from it. Really? Well, it's in Yicheon, Gyeonggi Do. Yeah. And so her mom like owned it in the past, but her mom got sick. She had like a stroke five years ago. So she basically gave it to my daughter or her daughter to run my wife. And then Covid hit and Covid destroyed the business. Really? Yeah. Because it means that before the COVID 19. Yeah. It was doing okay. The business was okay. Yeah. And then like it's also located at a bus terminal. And that bus terminal is like losing popularity these days. Like because it's close to Seoul. Now there's a subway stop that goes to Seoul. And the other thing is, we live in Seoul, so my wife has to, um, commute. So she doesn't want to work all day long. So she only usually goes at night. So she has to pay part timers. So like a lot of the profit. If you. The point is, what I've learned from my wife's business is if you want to open up a, like a cu. Or you want to open up a chicken place or a Dunkin Donuts, then if you want to make money, you've got to work all day and all night and hire like very minimal part timers. Yeah. Uh, so somebody told me that Doji Binis, uh, is uh, making money from the labor cost. Yes, right, Exactly. Right now I kind of, uh, disagree with him in not starting your own business. Because I think you could, you could start a business that is, um, not labor intensive. Those are, are capital intensive. Those businesses are capital intensive because you got to pay for the franchise. You got to pay for the location. If you opened up like a consulting business or where you're the consultant, that's like zero cost to start your network. That's the obvious. That's all right. Yeah. Or work from home. Why? Why? Why? Yeah. And then like, then you just think about your network and how to. And now you have AI, so you have an assistant so you could use AI So that kind of business I think would be you could do. But yeah, I agree. Anyway, she uh advised me not to open any small business especially for the uh, restaurant kind of business. And he advised me to move to another company if possible. And he asked me again what will be a better way uh between two scenarios. One is that I make my own uh, the resume M And then uh. Send it to the companies uh which I wanted to uh. I wanted to work for or some uh. Higher position. Uh People in other. In another company will just pick up me which way which will be the more. More possible. Then he uh. Said that the making the regimen and ah. Apply for certain company will not work in my age. Right. Okay. Too too old. But wait a second. I mean I know a little bit about you so I can say some things. He's thinking only about Korea though. You had talked about the fusion place in Europe. That's a different culture and a different thing. So that rule doesn't apply outside of Korea. I didn't mention about the company outside ah of Korea. He just um. Mentioned. I think he just uh. Imagine the circumstances in Korea. Right. So anyway he said that in Korean society uh. The next job opportunity will be decided by what I did. What I have done. Mhm. In khmp they are. Everybody outside of KHMP is looking at the managers, the high level managers in KGP to pick up somebody. Right. Okay. Right. Okay. That's good. I don't know. So he's saying like you got to use your network to be able to. To find a job. Yeah. But I really think you can do both because I think you have the. Your English ability is at a level that you can work internationally. There's no doubt in my mind. Right. Actually I told you about the um eater, the pugil. Right. And there are more than 80 Koreans working there. Mhm. Three or four managers from KTMP uh used to work iter people and one um manager who was very high level position. I think he was probably number second here the managers. Okay. But he couldn't uh maintain his position because of that. I think there are uh. Various reasons, several reasons why he couldn't maintain his position. But one of the reasons uh probably the language barrier. He told us that he was so stressful to communicate with other steps especially from the native. The English native speakers. Uh. Yeah. So. I think you can do it. So like I, I think I told you this before but like part of that's personality, you know what I mean? And culture. So like I think you have the personality to be able to do it. So I, my company, you know, like our, our startup. The companies we target are tire manufacturers. So I can tell you, one of them that we are meeting with is Continental from Germany, right? Who? Continental? Continental, yeah, it's like number, I don't know, three in the world tire manufacturer. And they have several Chinese high level employees that we have meetings with. Your English is far better and they have no problem communicating with. So I think part of its attitude, you got to have the attitude of like I don't care and your English is good enough. I think you should go for it. Yeah. Thank you very much. Yeah. I'd be honest, there's some people I teach that I might say, oh, I don't know, you need a little bit more time to study. But yeah, that's interesting. Okay. Um, when do you think, uh, people should start saving for retirement? What age? I think from the, from the beginning of the career, I think. Have you like, did you, do you give your son any financial planning advice? Have you told him to start to save? Yeah, actually, uh, I didn't do that because I, as I told you, I am regretful about my financial plan. Mhm. Um, when I entered my company, the national pension system, uh, has been just established. The national pension system was just established. So it was 1991, probably early 1990s. Okay. And then all employees in KGP, um, was automatically, uh, what is that? Um, uh, signed in. Yeah. Sign up. Signing. Right. Okay. Included. Included in the pension system. Sure. So the hype of the, the monthly pension has uh, been, uh, has been added by company and women. Happy. Has been borne by myself. And this is very good for me. Why I corrected uh, my pension for a long time. About 40 years. Sure. So I think uh, I am the thumbnail of the monthly pension. Right. But my two sons, my fourth son is in United States and he is managing uh, his salary by himself. Mhm. And as I know, he doesn't much care about the power. Right. Okay. For his retirement. Mhm. So just one year ago, I, I advise him to buy the S&P 500 ETF every, every month. Right. I think that's the best way. Yeah, it's the easy way. But I, I, I don't know what he's now doing. And the second son, he is very smarter than the first son, I think. Okay. But he didn't, he didn't, he didn't, he, he didn't have, uh, uh, he doesn't have regular, uh, job. I mean the company. Right. He's not uh, he doesn't work for any company. Right. He owned his own business. But he divided his money into several banking account. And he uh. We said he has some uh, monthly saving account. Yep. For housing. And here's some. A high uh, ratio interest bank account. And also he bought Bitcoin last summer. Okay. It was very low price. Mhm. Last summer. Last year. Right. And so he, I think he's managing his uh, money very well. Right. But the problem is that he doesn't have the long term financial plan. Mhm. So I will talk to him. Right. But he, I think he cannot do that because he uh, wants to open his own business. Right. Did I tell you he wants to open the boxing? Yep. He told me. He's in Song park too. Right, Right, right. He's now coach. Yeah. And um, he just almost all he passed the certification for the coaching or the boxing. And he's now on uh, his own education from the government. Yep. He should attend the class. Right. Okay. For 10 times. Okay. So he now the training. So he wants to open his own gym. Yeah. That's why he. I think he cannot uh, think about his hardest opponent for a long time. I. I mean I'm very outside the box. You probably know. Right. That's why like the like ideas I have, the business I do like I think outside of the box. Like I'm a weird thinker. But one thing I think is like for your son, I think it's like first of all in Seoul I've seen lots of people get rich from opening personal gyms. It's also a hard business because there's a lot of competition. But I know personally a guy who owns a CrossFit gym and he's rich because he manages the people that comes in. And uh, another big thing about those businesses in Seoul is community. So he has community and he has like in the summertime like they go the whole like members go camping and he makes it like a young people. Okay. It's like young people today in Korea, like they are not interested in going out and drinking soju like I did. Right. They like to exercise together. So it's almost like a bar or club. Right. Like where guys can meet girls, girls can meet guys and then they have older people too. But the focus is on the young people. Right. But uh, so I think, and I think also another thing is like with those businesses, I don't think AI is going to replace that quickly. Sure. So I think he's in a good. Space, cannot touch that business. Yeah. This is a human activity. Right. And you want a human training you. And so like I. I told you, I used to go to boxing. If your son opens a gin, send me the opening place and I'll. Cause I live in. So, yeah, I'll go. I mean, if he's opens his own. But, um, I show you the picture of my son. Yeah. Okay. This is my second. Wow. Oh. Right. Okay. I show you. He's. He's back. Oh, my gosh. He's an athlete. Yeah. He's got a fault. He knows what he's doing. He's following his passion. Right. So I think he has. And the other thing is, I would say is like, um, he looks young. Just one minute, please. Sure. Just one minute. Yeah.",
