  "feedback": "Strengths: The speaker demonstrates a basic ability to communicate personal preferences and experiences, particularly in relation to food and cooking, which is relevant to the task. The use of specific examples, such as preferring McDonald's and cooking pork with sauce, helps to convey personal habits and tastes. Weaknesses: The speaker's grammar control and use of cohesive devices are areas that need significant improvement. The speech is marked by frequent pauses, filler words ('um', 'uh'), and some grammatical inaccuracies that hinder clear communication. Additionally, the logical flow of ideas and the transition between topics can be more smoothly managed to enhance the overall coherence of the speech.",

    "full_transcript": "Like, usually most people say ramye in that case, but you're more of a Sam. Yup. Style person. It's only my daughter. Don't die. Um, boring part. Greasy. Yeah. Greasy part. So I usually, uh, cook pork with sauce. Okay. Would you consider yourself a good cook? I think my cook is. Cooking. Your food is good. What do you think? Because many, uh, men our age typically don't cook. Um, and if they do cook, it's usually like fried egg or, um, ramyun, maybe. Maybe some pasta. But you're cooking up some gyopsal with sauces and stuff. Um, that's very interesting. So where did you learn to cook? I cooked. I cooked. I sometimes cook in the army. Interesting. Yeah. Um, did you ever try to impress your wife with your cooking? Um, yes, my wife. I think my wife is good at cooking. Uh, my wife doesn't like, uh, cook. Oh, really? Okay. Um, yeah, because I was like, my wife, um, she doesn't like to cook, but she's not really good at cooking. Um, meaning that, like, um. Um, she's like. Like, she can cook, but, uh, it's. It's. She. She doesn't really have that sense of. You know what I mean? Like, if she. If she cooks something, it's. It's very deliberate. But sometimes she'll like. I'll be like, oh, this food's kind of. Something's not off. Uh. Oh, yeah, yeah. I didn't put any salt. You eat too much salt, yo. But, like, salt makes the food taste a little. No, you don't need salt yet. Okay. So, um, you know, I, um. She. She's not a big chef like that, so I get. I'm guessing your wife doesn't. She doesn't cook up a store. Interesting. What do you think about, like, because, like, the big difference in Canada. In Canada, we sort of have to cook apartment because, like, eating out is super expensive. Tipping is super expensive. Um, and you can go to the store and you can buy. Like, if you want to have chicken, you can go to the store and you can cook a chicken or you can barbecue steak or something like that. Um, but what about Korea? Because I noticed Korea groceries are more expensive, I think, than ordering. Um, I think ordering food and eating out is not that cheap. Prefer convenient thing, like ordering food, eating out. Yeah. Yeah. But which do you prefer? Like, um, do you like eating at your house? Like, do you like ordering in or eating out? I like ordering. Ordering in. Why is that. Nowadays? It's so hot. Yeah, I don't like. Yeah, I. I think I'm the same way. Like, um, two reasons. Uh, number one, people are loud and annoying. And number two is, like, unless it's a special event, I don't want to be around people. So I'd rather take the food back to my hotel or take the food back to my apartments and eat it there in privacy. Yeah. Um, but, um, uh, I think some people like to experience, uh, eating in a restaurant or something like that, but I, I don't. No use for that. Interesting. Uh, what. What is your favorite restaurant? Restaurant? Food. I like, um, fast food. You like fast food? I like McDonald's very much. Oh, really? You like McDonald's? Wow. What. What do you normally get at McDonald's? Uh, I usually get spicy. Ah, the chicken burger. Interesting. Yeah, I'm, I'm, um. I moved on from McDonald's. My, my M. My. I, uh, usually turn to the Burger King these days. I much prefer Burger King. And I almost, uh, every day I went to McDonald before entering this company. Oh, wow. Uh, uh, while I was preparing, uh. Uh, entering this company, you went to McDonald's, Big Mac. Big Mac every day? Yeah, I was. Yeah. For a while I was the same, only because I wasn't a fan of the fast food per se. I just wanted a place that was cheap, easy, and fast. And the problem is when you combine those three, you get fast food, and the closest place that was cheap, easy and fast across the street from my house. McDonald's. Yeah, so I, I went there usually maybe once a week, just, uh. But again, yeah, like these days, if I want a fast food burger, I go to the, the, the, uh, Burger King. To me, uh, now that they got the onion rings. What, what is one, One, um, restaurant or fast food chain that you don't like? Uh, uh, I don't like. Uh. Yeah, it's terrible. Terrible. I, I, Yeah, terrible. Why, why don't you like Loteria? I don't know, but it's not good. Bread and potato. Potatoes. No, the fries. Yeah, yeah, the bread. I. It's too crumbly. Like, it just cracks. Like it's, like it's not fresh. Maybe. Uh, when you've traveled abroad, have you, have you found any good fast food places? Uh, abroad? Yeah. Um, not yet. A lot of people, like in the Philippines, the, uh, Jollibee. Jollibee. Uh, yeah. And I heard recently Jollibee's company bought compost coffee. Yeah. So the Korean compost coffee is bought by Jollibee. Um, what was the best one I found in America? The, the, uh, In N Out Burger that's really good. Canada, maybe, uh, there are always. The lights are turning off. I don't know why. Maybe they're on a timer. Those are gone too. Um, what else? Uh, well, Canada, of course, Tim Hortons. But, um, they've gone downhill because. Well, Tim Hortons used to be their own company, and then they were bought by Global Brands Inc. Which is the Burger King, uh, parent company as well. Uh, so they're, they're sort of, um. Ah, they've streamlined the process, which makes the quality not good. So now when you, when you travel, uh, say for business trips or something, what kind of restaurants do you turn to? Are you, like, if, uh, you're in Korea, do you go to, like, the Guksu or the Samgyeopsal? Or do you revert back to your fast food days? Um, uh, on business trip, if I go, go to BJ trip for long, I think I will. Big Mac party. Yeah. Yeah, that's it. Like, for me, like that. Why bring this up is like, this weekend I've got to go up to Seoul, and my wife's always like, don't just eat fast food. I'm like, no way. And then, and then what usually happens is that I, I end up like, running around Seoul and my energy is like. And yeah, if I go to a Korean restaurant, like Bunchik Jib or, uh, I'm like. And then I'm like, usually because the places I stay at, like, the hotels, what's across the street? Burger King, you know, Lotteria, uh, McDonald's. I'm like. And, and I've tried because I was saying like, my wife, like, my wife saying like, you know, like, you're in Seoul, like, try, try something different. And so the last time I went to, uh, Seoul, Yeah. I went to five guys. Have you tried five guys? It's like a burger restaurant. Good God. Uh, and. And like, um, like, I didn't know. Like, I was again, I was exhausted. I'm waiting in line. There's so many people. So I was like, wow, this place is like, really popular up there. I'm like, yeah. Can I get the bacon cheeseburger? They're like, yeah. You want fries? Yeah. Cola? Uh, yeah. Okay. That'll, uh, be you, man. Chilchon. Too expensive? No, just one set. And then I look at the price. I'm like, non sachonan for the burger. Yeah. And then, you know, like another like six or seven bucks for the, uh, uh, fries. Then drink. And then like, the taxes. What the hell? And so, uh, the worst part Was was the five guys is at Seoul station. There's nowhere to sit. So I take pulse on go outside. You know where to sit. Go inside. Nowhere to sit. I was like so I have to take the subway all the way back to my hotel. Yeah. By that time it's cold. I'm just like cold. 27 burger. Um, have. What is the. Have you ever tried something that you've never heard of before? But it was absolutely delicious. Like have you ever gone to a new restaurant and it exceeded your expectations? Uh, yes. Uh, I went to business trip to Taejon. The store provide uh, kimchi and it was very. That's very good. Yeah because that, that's the problem like with me with deji cook pop. Like it has to be like really good. Uh, or it's like all the same to me. I mean like I, I don't mind did you guys. But I'm saying like when my wife is like this is the best veggie cookbook ever. I'm like crusade. She's like what do you mean? It's amazing. I'm like tastes like the last place that we went. No, it's different. I don't know like what makes a good deji gukbuck? Is it the meat flavor or the soup flavor? I think uh, some fried wok and meat. Yeah. Um, where's the place I went to recently that was really good? No, I haven't anything that really impressed me. I went, I went to a new um, uh, sub restaurant like the Sub Sandwich uh, in Seoul. It was. What was it called? Jimmy John's. And it was pretty good but not like amazing. It was just like, it was good. Um, I tried Shake Shack. Yeah. Like it wasn't like everyone's like oh my God, it's amazing. But it was like yeah, it wasn't that good. So this weekend I want to try some, some new stuff but I don't know any, any recommendations for, for Seoul. Are you um, do you know of any good restaurants in. In Jungu Seoul Jongno area? I don't know. Uh, I don't know about good restaurant but ah, nowadays I think the Subway is very. Yeah. The interesting thing I find about Subway and I always tell my students this years ago, many, many, many, many, many years ago. Twenty years ago, Subway was just starting in Korea. Um, there was like one place in Busan. There's one little place in usan. My Korean friends hated it and it was like. It wasn't that the food quality was bad. It was just. I said like why do you hate the sub. And so I don't want to choose my food. I don't want to choose the toppings. I. I don't want to eat with my hands. It's terrible. Then came, uh, what was that? Tokkaebi, the TV show with everybody's eating Subway. And they were the sponsor for all of these. Uh, now most of my Korean friends, they love, uh, Subway. I don't get it. Um, but I think it's because to me, honestly, um, 20 years ago, many of my Korean friends would never take away anything from their food. They, they. Everybody ate the same thing. But I think the current generation of, uh, kids have very distinct. They're. They're picky eaters. So maybe they don't like jalapeno or piman or. Or yongpa, so they don't want that. And then Subway is the only place that they can say like, all right, sir, we'll wrap things up here.",
