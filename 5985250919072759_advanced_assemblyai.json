  "feedback": "Strengths: The student was able to communicate basic ideas clearly, especially when discussing topics like maternity leave and the concept of substitute teachers, which shows a good grasp of specific vocabulary. The logical flow of the conversation was generally maintained, making it possible to follow the student's points despite some interruptions and hesitations. Weaknesses: Grammar control needs improvement, as there were several instances of incorrect verb tenses and sentence structures that could hinder clear understanding. Additionally, the use of cohesive devices and more varied vocabulary could enhance the clarity and richness of the discourse.",
