Yeah, I have variety of hobbies and um. Usually like once or twice a week I go um, ping pong with my husband. Ping pong? Yeah. Yeah. In my apartment there is a ping pong area. So so we go there um like almost like twice a week. And um. And not not. Not as a hobby but I um. I ride stationary bicycle at home like um. Every two days. M. Uh that's what I do nowadays uh to keep my. Keep me healthy. So uh. So that's what I do nowadays. And um. Yeah, I watch TV or like drama with my husband's sometimes. And uh. Nowadays I'm into Kian. Do you know Kian? Do you watch Korean TV show? No, I don't know Kian but Kian is um. He. He won the. The first prize of um um like TV show last. Last year. So he's was it like last year or two two years ago. But he's really fun fun guy. He. He's not like um. Comedian but he what he does is something really um. Hilarious. Like um. Uh. For example he um. In just reality show he just tear out the wet tissue to use it. Usually we need to open the. The open the scene so they can keep like red tissue but he just tear it and so he leaves. Uh. What is like like not in detail. How can I not in detail? Kind of crazy guy. Yeah. Yeah, kind of crazy crazy guy. Um He. He do things really m. Naturally but yeah but. But he um. He doesn't really mind about things. Like he um. If we go travel he just um. Wash with his clothes on. Clothes on. He does what he wants to do and he doesn't have idea of like social social norms kind of. Kind of. Yeah. So he just. He just uh. Dry it. Um like just squeeze it squeeze his clothes and he just says uh, you going to dry? Because there is. The weather is fine and dry. Yeah, he's he's crazy and he he Nowadays he's TV show is to go to Nepal or um he travel with his his um friends. M. And um. Yeah. So nowadays I watch the TV show and this quite crazy. And it's really popular I guess. Yeah, he's popular. Um maybe you um. So you don't watch any like Korean TV show? Maybe just like YouTube. YouTube and then Netflix. I, I watched like some kore dramas or something. Yeah. If you are um, interested in some like, traveling to like India or like some um, um, special countries like Madagascar. Yeah, he. So he went to all India, Madagascar and stuff. Yeah, he, he, I. I recharge. Um, um, actually that is m. So he born just to um. Uh, yeah, it's. It's difficult to translate. Um, yeah, so he.

That, that series wasn't really fun fun. But it got better. Or this series is better? Yeah, other series. Series are better fun. Yeah. That. This one. Two questions, one question about ping pong, actually. Because ping pong, uh, I was in Gangnam last year and there were some older ladies that told me they were doing ping pong. Uh, and actually it's funny too because like Korea, you can't just do like comfortably. You can't just do uh, like you always have to do hagwon or something. But she and like other Korean ladies were going to like ping pong. Hagwon. Uh, but the big one, Hagwon. Um, she said she was doing it for chime chime, you know, in English. Uh, I don't know, all time. Alzheimer's. Yeah, yeah. Alzheimer. Alzheimer. Yeah. Alzheimer or dementia. Very, very similar. Dementia Alzheimer's maybe. I hope AI picks that up so it gives automatic notes. But yeah. Um, so what's the reason for ping pong? Just. Just fun or just for fun? Uh, yeah, when Korean do hobbies, they um, do it with their heart. Exactly. Yeah. That's what I mean. M. Yeah. Yeah. They go to hagwon. Yeah. They try to learn it from the teacher or. Yeah, exactly. But I, I don't do that. Yeah, just for fun. Um, yeah, cuz like I swim or I've been swimming my whole life, right? In like in open water swimming and stuff. But I went to a pool a couple years ago with a Korean and then one of my friends and then he just started like lecturing me and saying that's not how I know it's not the correct form and I don't really care. I'm just. Yeah, I mean I'm enjoying. But then he ah, was like, no, no, you need to do this, you need to do that. Okay. Okay. So yeah, like you said, the hobbies they really take to next level, need to do perfectly. Even you are not major in swing. Yeah, yeah, exactly. I'm just trying to have fun. Um, but, yeah, interesting. And then, uh, with, uh, let's see, other Korean, like, dramas or shows. Do you only watch, like, uh, those type of shows, or do you watch a lot of other different Korean, like, drama and things? Oh, I actually don't watch Korean dramas much. Okay. But nowadays I'm watching the Breaking Bad. Actually, I already went through the Breaking Bad series. So after the Breaking Bad, there was, um, that. Lawyers. Lawyers, drama, Better Call Saul. Yeah, yeah. I'm watching Better Call Saul nowadays. M. Yeah, one minute. We got time. So Better Call Saul. Uh, so you. You've watched all of Breaking Bad and now Better Call Saul. Yeah. And you. I even watched that movie. Um, Movie. Um. Um, I forget the name too. But yeah, Mitch, the guy. Ah, the kid, the key. I forget. But he was an interesting character. Yeah. So, yeah, I watched the movie too, and yeah, actually Mitch was someone that I knew before. Yeah, interesting. Uh, and then, uh, with Breaking Bad, who is your favorite character? Uh, um, maybe nowadays I'm into this. This, um, song. So. Because he's interesting and as I watch the drama, um, as. As far as. As long as I is. Yeah, that character is really interesting. Yeah, he has many different kind of like, characteristic character. Very like 3D. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, he has many different levels. Many different levels to his personality. And, uh, he's always, always, uh, scheming. Yeah. So he's funny. He's probably my favorite character as well. But yeah, I can never tell if someone's waiting or not. But me.",
