  "feedback": "Strengths: The student demonstrates a good ability to discuss a variety of hobbies, indicating a decent range of vocabulary and the ability to maintain a conversation on familiar topics. The use of specific examples, such as playing ping pong and riding a stationary bicycle, adds to the clarity of the speech. Weaknesses: The student's use of fillers ('um', 'uh') and some hesitation detracts from the overall fluency. Additionally, the grammatical structure and use of cohesive devices could be improved to enhance the logical flow of ideas and coherence of the speech.",

Fun, but it got better. Or this series is better? Yeah, other series. Series are better fun. Yeah. That. This one. Two questions, one question about ping pong, actually, because ping pong, uh, I was in Gangnam last year and there were some older ladies that told me they were doing ping pong. Uh, and actually it's funny too because like Korea, you can't just do like comfortably. You can't just do, uh, like you always have to do hagwon or something. But she and like other Korean ladies were going to like ping pong. Hagwon. Uh, but the big one, Hagwon. Um, she said she was doing it for chime chime, you know, in English. Uh, I don't know, all time. Alzheimer's. Yeah, yeah. Alzheimer. Alzheimer, yeah. Alzheimer or dementia. Very, very similar. Dementia Alzheimer's maybe. I hope AI picks that up so it gives automatic notes. But yeah. Um, so what's the reason for ping pong? Just. Just fun or just for fun? Uh, yeah, when Korean do hobbies, they do it with their heart. Exactly. Yeah. That's what I mean. M. Yeah. Yeah. They go to hagwon. Yeah. They try to learn it from the teacher or. Yeah, exactly. But I, I don't do that. Yeah. Ah, just for fun. Yeah. Cuz like I swim or I've been swimming my whole life, right? In like in open water swimming and stuff. But I went to a pool a couple years ago with a Korean and then one of my friends and then he just started like lecturing me and saying that's not how I know it's not the correct form and I don't really care. I'm just. Yeah, I mean, I'm enjoying. But then he was like, no, no, you need to do this, you need to do that. Okay. Okay. So yeah, like you said, the hobbies, they really Take to next level. Need to do perfectly. Even you are not major in swing. Yeah, yeah, exactly. I'm just trying to have fun. Um, but, yeah, interesting. And then, uh, with, uh, let's see, other Korean, like, dramas or shows. Do you only watch, like, uh, those type of shows, or do you watch a lot of other different Korean, like, drama and things? Oh, I actually don't watch Korean dramas much. Okay. But nowadays I'm watching the Breaking Bad. Actually, I already went through the Breaking Bad series, so after the Breaking Bad, there was, um, that. Lawyers. Lawyers. Drama, Better Call Saul. Yeah, yeah.

So, yeah, I watched the movie too, and, yeah, actually, Mitch was someone that I knew before. Yeah, interesting. Uh, and then, uh, with Breaking Bad, who is your favorite character?
